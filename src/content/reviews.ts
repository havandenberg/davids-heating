      'David was a true pro and we were lucky to find him for our boiler replacement project. After receiving a very high quote for the project from our "trusted" oil company, my wife and I decided to get some other quotes for the job. David gave us a quote that worked with our budget and we just had a good rapport with him when he came to our home to look at our current heating system. David did a superior job communicating with us while setting up the timing of the project, letting us know the status during the project, and finally letting us know when the project was compete. We were very satisfied with the work he did, would recommend him highly, and would use him again.',

      'Working with David was absolutely wonderful. First of all, he is extremely personable and up front. He\'s also prompt, a great communicator and hard working. Any issues that popped up during installation were handled right away and he did a fabulous job even considering the fact that the builders of my home cut some corners with the forced air system he had to work with. My house feels great! I\'m keeping his number on hand for any heating/cooling needs I may have and I would definitely recommend him.',

      'David called me within minutes of filling out my service request and within 24 hours he had been to my house and fixed my central a/c. I had used another company and for two years they were charging me for recharging the unit without actually fixing the problem. David found the leak and fixed it immediately, I couldn\'t be happier with the quick service he provided. I would definitely recommend him to a friend.',
